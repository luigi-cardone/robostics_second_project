# Second Project

## Overview

The `second_project` package is designed to demonstrate robotic simulation and autonomous navigation using a custom robot model in a simulated environment. This package leverages various ROS tools to perform Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), path planning, and navigation, allowing the robot to autonomously navigate through a predefined map while avoiding obstacles.

## Features

- **Robot Simulation:** Simulate the custom robot model using Stage and Gazebo simulators.
- **SLAM:** Implement SLAM using GMapping and SLAM Toolbox to create and update maps in real-time.
- **Navigation:** Perform autonomous navigation using the `move_base` stack, which includes path planning and obstacle avoidance.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the robot, environment, and navigation goals in RViz.
